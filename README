This project is a subproject of my xbrlparser project.

The XML Base specification (http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-xmlbase-20090128/) says:
"The attribute xml:base may be inserted in XML documents to specify a base URI other than the base URI of the document or external entity. The value of this attribute is interpreted as a Legacy Extended IRI (LEIRI) as defined in the W3C Note "Legacy extended IRIs for XML resource identification" [LEIRI]."

I needed to be able to parse LEIRI strings.

This project implements the LEIRI productions as defined at http://www.w3.org/TR/leiri/.

The parser is generated from a Treetop (http://treetop.rubyforge.org/) grammar.
